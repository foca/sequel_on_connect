= Sequel.on_connect

Run code immediately after a database connection has been established.

== How to use?

    require "sequel"
    require "sequel_on_connect"

    Sequel.on_connect do
      require "my_models"
    end
    
    Sequel.connect("sqlite::memory:")

== Why?

`Sequel` requires you to establish a connection *before* loading your
model classes. If, for some reason, you can't establish a connection
before loading your classes, then this will allow you to require them
immediately after you connect to the database.
